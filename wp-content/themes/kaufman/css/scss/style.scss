/*! This CSS Main Stylesheet isn't meant to update and might get confusing real quick, please use the scss partials in /css/scss */
/*! Theme Name: Kaufman Author: Garrett Cullen */


/* Internal pages on this site have three vairations of the same template (generally).... 
	
	
What started as one global internal template quickly turned into semi-similiar sections that got complicated quick. The design mock ups are just about similiar but different. Therefore, I had to use alot of redundant css. Below are the files I have slightly modified on each template. These are powered by no class, ".non_banner_layout" or ".non_banner_layout.centered_layout" combo in each page-template.php file.
	
Edits to SCSS Partials are in:
	
	1. _internal_banner_layout.scss is first. Then:
	2. _internal_non_banner_layout.scss, and last 
	3. _internal_centered_layout.scss
